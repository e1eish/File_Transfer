# Overview

This is a simple program to transfter files from a server to a client. First run the server with the file path of the file to be transfered in the constant variable FILENAME, then run the client with file path to save to in FILENAME.

This was made to learn and practice the basics of networking with TCP and sockets.

# Network Communication

This uses client/server architecture using the socket python library. TCP was used on port 65432. The messages sent are json files in the form of strings.

# Development Environment

This program was written in python using Visual Studio Code. The socket library was necessary to set up sockets and stream data.
